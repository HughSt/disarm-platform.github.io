DiSARM development is a team effort. To ensure we are building DiSARM in the right way to do the right things, we are working very closely with the National Malaria Control Programs of Swaziland and Zimbabwe. The Clinton Health Access Initiative is also a key technical and operational partner, supporting the project through working side-by-side with the DiSARM team in Swaziland and Zimbabwe to better understand National Malaria Control Program requirements.
